module Juicer
  #
  # Provides dependency resolution for linked files. To include the module in a
  # class, the class needs to provide an io accessor which should return an
  # object with an <tt>open</tt> method that yields an IO stream.
  #
  # = Overview
  #
  # Given an class <tt>Resource</tt> (and instance <tt>resource</tt>) that
  # includes the module, these are the methods provided.
  #
  # Depend on another resource.
  #   resource.depend(Resource.new("myfile"))
  #
  # You can depend on the file directly, Juicer will wrap it in an instance of
  # the including class (e.g. <tt>Resource</tt> in this example) for you
  #   resource.depend("myfile.txt")
  #
  # <tt><<</tt> is an alias for depend
  #   resource << "myfile.txt"
  #
  # List all dependencies
  #   resource.dependencies #=> [#<Resource:"myfile.txt">]
  #
  # List all resources. This includes self in the list:
  #   resource.resources #=> [#<Juicer::Resource:[unsaved]>, #<Juicer::Resource:"myfile.txt">]
  #
  # Wrap an existing CSS resource in a <tt>Juicer::CSS</tt> instance
  #   css = Juicer::CSS.new("myfile.css")
  #   css.dependencies # Lists all @import'ed files (recursively) as Juicer::CSS objects

  module DependencyResolver

    #
    # Lists all dependencies, either added in through the depend method, or
    # through dependency statements in the source content. The method accepts an
    # options hash which can specify the <tt>:recursive</tt> option. If
    # <tt>true</tt>, all nested dependencies will be load. The default value is
    # <tt>false</tt>, producing a list of files directly depended on by the
    # resource. Dependencies are returned as an array of instances of the class
    # including the module. Files are resolved through <tt>Juicer::IOProxy</tt>,
    # meaning they can exist anywhere on <tt>Juicer.load_path</tt>, not
    # necessarily in the current directory.

    # for possible options.

    #
    # Reads the contents of the resource. By default only the content of the
    # resource is read out. The <tt>:inline_dependencies</tt> option can be
    # provided to concatenate all dependencies and produce the full listing. In
    # this case any dependency statements are removed from the resulting string, to
    # avoid loading/depending on dependencies twice.

    # <tt>Juicer::IOProxy</tt> object, meaning you can provide it any one of the
    # inputs <tt>Juicer::IOProxy.new</tt> accepts. The options hash is passed to
    # #read, refer to its documentation for possible options to provide. If a
    # string is passed to #export, it is used as a file name (i.e., if you want
    # to write to a string, pass a StringIO instance).
