# Juicer is a command line tool aimed at frontend web developers. It provides a
# utility belt for managing dependencies for CSS and JavaScript, concatenating
# and minifying files as well as a number of additional helpful tools, including
#
# * Cache busters - adding timestamps to URL's in CSS files to combat caching of updated files when using a far future expires header
# * Asset host cycling/domain sharding
# * Embedding of images in CSS files using data URI's or MHTML (IE)
# * Verifying JavaScript syntax through JsLint
# * Testing JavaScript, currently only by using JsTestDriver
# * Producing documentation of JavaScript files.
#
# Additionally, Juicer provides a powerful API to access all these features - in
# isolation or in combination - through Ruby code, meaning you can embed
# performance improving functionality directly in your web application without
# using the command line binary.
#
# The Juicer main module provides a version constant,
# <tt>Juicer::VERSION</tt> and method <tt>Juicer.version</tt> as well as the
# Juicer installation directory, <tt>Juicer.home</tt>, where extras like
# third-party binaries are located.
#
# The installation directory is normally <tt>~/.juicer</tt>, but a number of
# other guesses are made if you're on a non-Unix system. You can set the
# installation directory through <tt>Juicer.home=</tt>
