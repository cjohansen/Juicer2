Juicer is a command line tool aimed at frontend web developers. It provides a
utility belt for managing dependencies for CSS and JavaScript, concatenating
and minifying files as well as a number of additional helpful tools, including

* Cache busters - adding timestamps to URL's in CSS files to combat caching of updated files when using a far future expires header
* Asset host cycling/domain sharding
* Embedding of images in CSS files using data URI's or MHTML (IE)
* Verifying JavaScript syntax through JsLint
* Testing JavaScript, currently only by using JsTestDriver
* Producing documentation of JavaScript files.

Additionally, Juicer provides a powerful API to access all these features - in
isolation or in combination - through Ruby code, meaning you can embed
performance improving functionality directly in your web application without
using the command line binary.
