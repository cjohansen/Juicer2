== 0.9.99/1.0.0-preview1 / 2009-12-xx
* Almost complete rewrite: New solid APIs for interacting with Juicer through
  Ruby code. Solid documentation of new APIs. More granular command-line

  reading from STDIN, writing to STDOUT, using exit codes and so on.

* New installation paths for YUI Compressor
  Patch by http://github.com/craveytrain

  by spaces) resolved wrong.

== 0.2.4 / 2009-04-29

* More robust pattern checking for url() references in CSS files
* Allow skipping verification
* Bug fix: Skip cache buster if type=none
* Bug fix: Quote JsLint command parts to allow for spaces in jar file paths
* Bug fix: cache buster type wasn't carried all the way (ie had no effect)

== 0.2.3 / 2009-03-03

* Cache busters in CSS files should only be appended once to each URL
* Output to merge target should accept directories as well as files (in case of
  directories, file name is generated)
* Tests should not ship with 3rd party libraries
